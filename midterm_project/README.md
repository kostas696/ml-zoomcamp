# Midterm Project

## Gym Members Calories Prediction with CatBoost

---

## Overview

This project predicts the number of calories burned by gym members during exercise sessions based on health and activity features. The model was trained using CatBoost, achieving high accuracy, and deployed as a web service via FastAPI. The service is containerized using Docker for easy deployment.

---

## Problem Description

Accurate calorie prediction supports:
- Personalized fitness planning.
- Progress tracking towards health goals.
- Insights for gym members to optimize their workouts.

The objective is to build and deploy a regression model for real-time calorie prediction.

---

## Data Overview

The dataset includes:
- **Numerical Features**:
  - Session Duration
  - Workout Intensity
  - Fat Percentage
  - BMI
  - Heart Rate Difference
  - Age
  - Height
  - Resting BPM
  - Water Intake
  - Workout Frequency
- **Target Variable**: `calories_burned`

Preprocessing steps include feature engineering, encoding categorical features, and feature selection.

---

## Workflow and Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed distributions and correlations.
- Addressed missing and redundant data.

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Engineered derived features:
  - **Workout Intensity** = Calories Burned / Session Duration
  - **Heart Rate Difference** = Max BPM - Resting BPM
- Applied feature selection using RFE and SHAP values.

### 3. Model Training
- Experimented with models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Ridge Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - CatBoost
- Tuned CatBoost hyperparameters with **Optuna**.
- Best RMSE on test set: **8.13**.

### 4. Model Deployment
- Built a FastAPI service for prediction.
- Containerized the service using Docker.

# Prediction Service and Deployment Workflow

## **Running the Prediction Service**

### **Start the FastAPI Service**
Run the FastAPI service locally:

```bash
uvicorn src.predict:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload


# Prediction Service and Deployment Workflow

## **Test the Service Using `curl`**

Send a POST request to test the prediction service:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
     'http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict' \
     -H 'accept: application/json' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '[ 
         {
             "session_duration": 1.5,
             "workout_intensity": 750.0,
             "fat_percentage": 20.0,
             "bmi": 25.0,
             "heart_rate_difference": 50,
             "age": 30,
             "height": 1.75,
             "resting_bpm": 60,
             "water_intake": 2.5,
             "workout_frequency": 3
         },
         {
             "session_duration": 2.0,
             "workout_intensity": 800.0,
             "fat_percentage": 22.0,
             "bmi": 24.0,
             "heart_rate_difference": 60,
             "age": 28,
             "height": 1.80,
             "resting_bpm": 58,
